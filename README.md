# A Teacher Reflection Tool

## Overview:
In this web application, teachers will find a tool in which they can reflect upon learning strategies that they use to teach and assess criteria. They are also able to access the learning criteria, using the International Baccalaureate's assessment criteria for year 5 of the Middle Years Programme, focusing on the Individuals and Societies subject group. Using the form on the web application, teachers can collect information about what works with different strategies, and plans that they have to improve upon strategies so they can refine their instruction and assessment of the criteria. One of the main aims of this tool is to help teachers build a fully criteria-based teaching practice.

## Features:
- **Criteria:** The criteria and their individual strands are rendered to the page for inspection.

- **Strategy Reflection Tool:** A form allows teachers to reflect upon the teaching strategies that they use, and log information so that they can begin to build a tool that helps them easily access strategies for use in the classroom, while intentionally connecting each to criteria.


## Data Source:
The data used in this application comes from an internal db.json file that consists of learning criteria. This is the criteria used in the International Baccalaureate's Middle Years Program (typically grades six through ten in the U.S.). The focus of this application is the tenth grade learning criteria (year 5) for the Individuals and Societies subject group (often referred to as "Social Studies" in the U.S.).

## Technologies Used:
This application is styled with CSS, formatted with HTML and run by JavaScript.

## How to Run the Application:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run **json-server --watch db.json** to get the backend started.
3. Open the **index.html** file in your web browser to view the web application.
